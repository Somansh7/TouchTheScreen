## TouchTheScreen

## Abstract

We aim to create a device which adds touch screen input to any desktop screen.Our project is to construct a portable frame for a laptop display, which can be detached and reattached by the user, enabling touchscreen functionality whenever the user feels the need for it.
We will achieve this by using infrared technology.
Coding in Arduino will enable us to convert the output into readable format and mouse tracking will be done accordingly.
This will be a cheaper alternative when compared to buying an actual touchscreen laptop.
