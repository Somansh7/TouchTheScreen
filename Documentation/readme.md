## TouchTheScreen

## Abstract

We aim to create a device which adds touch screen input to any desktop screen.Our project is to construct a portable frame for a laptop display, which can be detached and reattached by the user, enabling touchscreen functionality whenever the user feels the need for it.
We will achieve this by using infrared technology.
Coding in Arduino will enable us to convert the output into readable format and mouse tracking will be done accordingly.
This will be a cheaper alternative when compared to buying an actual touchscreen laptop.

## 1.Introduction
### 1.1 Motivation

Touch-screen technology has found use in devices ranging from cell phones to supermarket checkouts. While implementing a touch screen may involve additional expenses above other methods of input we here decided to make a low cost and robust model that will convert our laptop screen touch sensitive.
Touch screens also increase the speed of tasks.Touch screens allow users to select icons directly, without worrying about aligning cursor in horizontal and vertical directions in case of mouse or trackpad.
Touch screens are also valuable in accommodating users with physical issues that might make a traditional mouse and keyboard setup difficult to use.

### 1.2 Working Rule

We had three ideas in mind for this project 
* Having four emitters on four corners of the screen, and receiver on the pen.
* One with four receivers on the corners and emitter on the pen.
* One with array of emitters and receivers on the screen itself with no need for a pen.
